  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    # - family: Lora
    # fonts:
    # - asset: assets/fonts/Lora-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf
    # - asset: assets/fonts/Lora-VariableFont_wght.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
